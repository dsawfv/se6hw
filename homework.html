            <h2 class="h2-head">What is the World Cup?</h2>
            <p class="para">The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.</p>

            <p class="para">The format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify to the group stage of the tournament.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-head">How did the World Cup 2022 go?</h2>
            <p class="para">Overall it was a very great world cup. The games were mostly entertaining with some pretty big upsets that would be explained in detail later. But to me one of the biggest reasons why this was so entertaining was because of what was at stake.<br>There were many aging fan-favorites who have not yet lifted the trophy and this World Cup would likely be their last. Such fan-favorites inclued Lionel Messi of Argentina, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, and Neymar Jr. of Brazil.<br> The world cup ended in a spectacular final of Argentina vs. France, and after a heated game played amazingly by both sides, Argentina prevailed in the penalty shootouts, winning 4-2.</p>

            <p class="para">There have been much controversy about how the World Cup was somehow rigged in Argentina's favor. <br><br>The fact is almost all of these allegations are from either crying Ronaldo fans who've sent death threats to a 9 year old girl who celebrated her country's victory over Portugal, or angry frenchmen who are mad that their country didn't win the World Cup twice in a row, all with zero evidence but the fact that Messi had a lot of penalties, all of which were proven fair. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldcup/comments/zxm5tu/why_so_many_people_are_saying_that_the_world_cup/" target="_blank">This</a> is a very good post going into the allegations.<br><br>So was it rigged? The answer is no. And if you think otherwise, please shut the ██ up and go play tennis.</a></p>
